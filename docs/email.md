# Emailing

We integrate with Resend API.

We set up using their [NextJS quickstart](https://resend.com/docs/send-with-nextjs).

We have a basic email template at `components/email/email-template.tsx` and demo sending route at `app/api/send/route.ts`.

We need to think about styling this email template. I heard Resend uses `react-email` but don't see any relevant docs.
