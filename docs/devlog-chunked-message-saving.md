# Devlog: Implementing Chunked Message Saving with Debouncing

Date: [Current Date]

## Summary of Changes

We have implemented a new system for saving assistant messages in chunks as they are generated, with debouncing to reduce database load. This change allows for more responsive updates to the UI and better handling of long-running message generation.

Key changes:

1. Modified the `infer` function in `inngest/functions/processMessage/infer.ts` to create and update messages as chunks come in.
2. Created a new `createOrUpdateAssistantMessage` function in `inngest/functions/processMessage/saveAssistantMessage.ts` with debouncing to save once every 0.5 seconds.
3. Updated the `processMessage` function in `inngest/functions/processMessage/index.ts` to use the new chunked saving approach.
4. Modified the `messages` schema in `convex/schema/messages.ts` to include a `status` field for tracking message completion.

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Modifying the `infer` function

In `inngest/functions/processMessage/infer.ts`, we updated the `infer` function to handle chunk-by-chunk saving:

- Added `threadId` and `userId` to the `InferProps` interface.
- Modified the `onChunk` callback to call `createOrUpdateAssistantMessage` for each received chunk.
- Added a final call to `createOrUpdateAssistantMessage` after collecting the full response.

### 2. Creating `createOrUpdateAssistantMessage`

In `inngest/functions/processMessage/saveAssistantMessage.ts`, we implemented a new function:

- Added debouncing logic using `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`.
- Implemented logic to either create a new message or update an existing one based on whether a `messageId` exists.
- Added an `isPartial` flag to distinguish between partial and complete messages.
- Modified the `SaveAssistantMessageProps` interface to include the `isPartial` flag and make `usage` optional.

### 3. Updating `processMessage`

In `inngest/functions/processMessage/index.ts`, we simplified the `processMessage` function:

- Removed the separate step for saving the assistant message, as it's now handled within the `infer` function.
- Updated the `infer` function call to include `threadId` and `userId`.

### 4. Modifying the `messages` schema

In `convex/schema/messages.ts`, we added a new field to the schema:

- Added a `status` field of type `v.string()` to track whether a message is partial or complete.

## Additional Considerations

1. Frontend Updates: The UI components that display messages will need to be updated to handle partial messages and status updates. This may involve adding loading indicators or animations to show that a message is still being generated.

2. Convex Backend: The `updateChatMessage` mutation in the Convex backend needs to be implemented or updated to handle updating existing messages. This mutation should be able to update all fields of a message, including the new `status` field.

3. Error Handling: Additional error handling may be necessary in the `createOrUpdateAssistantMessage` function to deal with potential network issues or database errors during the debounced saves.

4. Performance Monitoring: It would be beneficial to add logging or monitoring to track the performance impact of this change, especially focusing on database write operations and any potential impact on read operations.

5. Testing: Comprehensive testing should be implemented to ensure that messages are saved correctly, both in chunks and as complete messages. This should include edge cases such as very long messages, messages with multiple tool calls, and scenarios where errors occur during message generation.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the `updateChatMessage` mutation in the Convex backend.
2. Update frontend components to handle partial messages and status updates.
3. Add error handling and logging to the new message saving process.
4. Develop and run tests for the new chunked message saving system.
5. Monitor system performance after deploying these changes to ensure there are no negative impacts on database or overall system performance.

By implementing these changes, we've significantly improved the responsiveness and efficiency of our message handling system, providing a better user experience for long-running message generation tasks.
