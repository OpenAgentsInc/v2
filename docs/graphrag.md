# GraphRAG Implementation for OpenAgents

## Introduction
GraphRAG is a structured, hierarchical approach to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that can significantly enhance the capabilities of our AI productivity dashboard. By implementing a basic version of GraphRAG, we can improve the system's ability to understand and reason about the complex relationships within our codebase and user data.

## How GraphRAG Can Help OpenAgents

1. **Enhanced Code Understanding**: By creating a knowledge graph of our codebase, we can help the AI better understand the relationships between different components, functions, and data structures.

2. **Improved Query Responses**: GraphRAG can provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries about the codebase, features, or documentation.

3. **Holistic View of User Data**: By applying GraphRAG to user threads and messages, we can create a more comprehensive understanding of user interactions and conversations over time.

4. **Better Thread Management**: GraphRAG can help in generating more accurate thread titles and summaries by considering the broader context of conversations.

5. **Advanced Search Capabilities**: Implementing GraphRAG can enable more sophisticated search functionality across threads and messages.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Define TextUnits**: 
   - Use individual GitHub files in our repo as TextUnits for the codebase.
   - For user data, consider using individual messages or entire threads as TextUnits.

2. **Entity Extraction**:
   - For codebase: Extract functions, classes, variables, and file names as entities.
   - For user data: Extract key concepts, user names, and important terms from messages and threads.

3. **Relationship Extraction**:
   - For codebase: Identify imports, function calls, and data flow between components.
   - For user data: Track conversation flow, topic relationships, and user interactions.

4. **Knowledge Graph Construction**:
   - Use Convex's existing capabilities, including vector similarity search, to store and query entities and relationships.
   - Implement a basic version of the Leiden algorithm for community detection, if possible within Convex's constraints.

5. **Summary Generation**:
   - Develop a system to generate summaries for code components and user threads.
   - Use existing AI capabilities to create concise descriptions of entities and communities.

6. **Query System Enhancement**:
   - Modify the existing chat system to incorporate GraphRAG-based retrieval.
   - Implement both global and local search functionalities as described in the GraphRAG documentation.

7. **Integration with Existing Systems**:
   - Update the `useChat.ts` hook to incorporate GraphRAG-enhanced responses.
   - Modify relevant Convex functions (e.g., `saveChatMessage.ts`, `getThreadMessages.ts`) to work with the new graph structure.

8. **UI Updates**:
   - Enhance the chat pane to visualize relationships between messages and concepts.
   - Add a new pane for exploring the knowledge graph of the codebase.

## Proposed Convex Schemas for GitHub Codebase Indexing

To implement GraphRAG for indexing a GitHub codebase using Convex, we propose the following schemas:

```typescript
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export default defineSchema({
  // ... (existing schemas)

  codeFiles: defineTable({
    repo_id: v.string(),
    path: v.string(),
    content: v.string(),
    last_updated: v.string(),
    embedding: v.array(v.number()), // Vector embedding for similarity search
  })
    .index('by_repo_id', ['repo_id'])
    .index('by_path', ['repo_id', 'path'])
    .vectorIndex('by_embedding', {
      vectorField: 'embedding',
      dimensions: 1536, // Adjust based on the embedding model used
    }),

  codeEntities: defineTable({
    repo_id: v.string(),
    file_id: v.id("codeFiles"),
    type: v.string(), // e.g., "function", "class", "variable"
    name: v.string(),
    start_line: v.number(),
    end_line: v.number(),
    description: v.optional(v.string()),
    embedding: v.array(v.number()), // Vector embedding for similarity search
  })
    .index('by_repo_id', ['repo_id'])
    .index('by_file_id', ['file_id'])
    .index('by_type', ['repo_id', 'type'])
    .vectorIndex('by_embedding', {
      vectorField: 'embedding',
      dimensions: 1536, // Adjust based on the embedding model used
    }),

  codeRelationships: defineTable({
    repo_id: v.string(),
    source_entity_id: v.id("codeEntities"),
    target_entity_id: v.id("codeEntities"),
    type: v.string(), // e.g., "imports", "calls", "inherits"
    description: v.optional(v.string()),
  })
    .index('by_repo_id', ['repo_id'])
    .index('by_source', ['source_entity_id'])
    .index('by_target', ['target_entity_id']),

  codeCommunities: defineTable({
    repo_id: v.string(),
    name: v.string(),
    description: v.string(),
    members: v.array(v.id("codeEntities")),
    embedding: v.array(v.number()), // Vector embedding for similarity search
  })
    .index('by_repo_id', ['repo_id'])
    .vectorIndex('by_embedding', {
      vectorField: 'embedding',
      dimensions: 1536, // Adjust based on the embedding model used
    }),
});
```

These schemas allow us to:

1. Store individual code files with their content and vector embeddings.
2. Extract and store code entities (functions, classes, variables) with their locations and descriptions.
3. Capture relationships between code entities.
4. Group related entities into communities for higher-level understanding.
5. Utilize Convex's vector similarity search capabilities for efficient querying.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the proposed schemas in the Convex configuration.
2. Develop scripts to parse GitHub repositories and populate the Convex tables.
3. Create functions to generate and update vector embeddings for files, entities, and communities.
4. Implement basic entity and relationship extraction for the codebase.
5. Create a simple knowledge graph visualization tool using the stored data.
6. Modify the chat system to incorporate basic GraphRAG concepts, utilizing Convex's vector search capabilities.
7. Test and iterate on the implementation, focusing on performance and accuracy.

By implementing GraphRAG using Convex's capabilities, we can significantly enhance OpenAgents' ability to understand and reason about codebases, providing users with more insightful and context-aware interactions with both the AI and the codebase.
