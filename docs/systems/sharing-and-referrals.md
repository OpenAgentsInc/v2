# Sharing and Referrals

On the Chats pane, the ChatsActions component includes a button to share a chat.

The button must pop up a modal window explaining that there's a share link that will let the public access current and future messages in that chat thread. That modal also includes a button to share on twitter, and a button to copy the share link to the clipboard, and a message like "Anyone who signs up after clicking your link will give you $5 of credit."

The share link is `https://openagents.com/share/{threadId}`
