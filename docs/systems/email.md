# Email System

Our email system uses Convex for data storage and Inngest for queueing and background processing. This document outlines the setup, capabilities, and implementation plan.

## Current Setup

- Convex: Stores email data and user preferences
- Inngest: Handles email queueing and background processing
- HUD Interface: Controls email operations and displays analytics

## Capabilities

1. Single and bulk email sending
2. Email queueing and background processing
3. User email preference management
4. Email analytics and visualization

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Update Convex Schema

Modify `convex/schema.ts` to include:
- `emails`: Store individual email data
- `emailCampaigns`: Manage email campaigns
- `emailAudiences`: Store audience information

### 2. Implement Convex Functions

Create `convex/emails/` folder with:
- `queueEmail.ts`: Queue emails for processing
- `createCampaign.ts`: Create email campaigns
- `addToAudience.ts`: Manage email audiences
- `getEmailStats.ts`: Retrieve email analytics
- `index.ts`: Export all email-related functions

### 3. Set Up Inngest

1. Install Inngest: `npm install inngest`
2. Create `lib/inngest.ts` for Inngest client and email processing functions
3. Implement email queueing and processing logic

### 4. Create Email Management HUD Pane

Add `panes/email/` folder with:
- `EmailPane.tsx`: Main container for email management
- `EmailList.tsx`: Display list of sent/scheduled emails
- `EmailCompose.tsx`: Interface for composing new emails
- `EmailCampaign.tsx`: Interface for creating and managing email campaigns

Use Shad UI components from `components/ui/` for consistency.

### 5. Implement Email Templates

- Enhance `components/email/email-template.tsx`
- Create additional templates for different purposes (welcome, newsletter, etc.)
- Use React Email components for styling and responsiveness

### 6. Update User Management

- Modify `convex/users/getUserData.ts` to include email preferences
- Add `convex/users/updateEmailPreferences.ts` for managing user email settings

### 7. Add Email Analytics

- Implement `convex/emails/getEmailAnalytics.ts` to fetch and process engagement data
- Create visualization components in the email HUD pane

### 8. Testing and Security

- Create unit tests for new Convex functions
- Add integration tests for the email HUD pane
- Implement access controls in Convex functions
- Ensure compliance with anti-spam laws and data protection regulations

## Best Practices

- Always include unsubscribe links in outgoing emails
- Follow anti-spam laws and data protection regulations
- Regularly monitor and analyze email performance metrics
- Keep email templates responsive and compatible across different clients

## Next Steps

1. Implement the email queueing mechanism using Inngest
2. Create Inngest functions for processing queued emails
3. Develop the email management HUD pane
4. Implement user email preference management
5. Set up email scheduling capabilities
6. Develop email analytics and visualization components
7. Conduct thorough testing of all new features
8. Ensure security measures and compliance with email regulations
