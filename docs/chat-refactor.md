# Chat Refactor Plan

This document outlines the plan for refactoring the chat-related components and functionality in our project.

## Objectives

1. Move and consolidate the `components/chat/` directory to `panes/chat/` (COMPLETED)
2. Refactor and simplify the duplicates between `store/chat.ts` and `hooks/useChat.ts` (COMPLETED)
3. Ensure the chat pane consumes the refactored functionality correctly (COMPLETED)

## Step 1: Move and Consolidate `components/chat/` to `panes/chat/` (COMPLETED)

1. Create a new directory: `panes/chat/` (DONE)
2. Move all files from `components/chat/` to `panes/chat/` (DONE)
3. Update import statements in all moved files to reflect the new directory structure (DONE)
4. Update any files that import from `components/chat/` to import from `panes/chat/` instead (DONE)
5. Remove the now-empty `components/chat/` directory (DONE)

## Step 2: Refactor `store/chat.ts` and `hooks/useChat.ts` (COMPLETED)

1. Analyze the contents of both files to identify duplicated functionality (DONE)
2. Create a new file `panes/chat/chatUtils.ts` to house shared functionality (DONE)
3. Move common functions and types to `chatUtils.ts` (DONE)
4. Update `store/chat.ts`:
   - Import shared functionality from `chatUtils.ts` (DONE)
   - Remove any duplicated code (DONE)
   - Ensure it only contains store-specific logic (DONE)
5. Update `hooks/useChat.ts`:
   - Import shared functionality from `chatUtils.ts` (DONE)
   - Remove any duplicated code (DONE)
   - Ensure it only contains hook-specific logic (DONE)
6. Consider merging `store/chat.ts` into `hooks/useChat.ts` if there's significant overlap (NOT NEEDED)

## Step 3: Update Chat Pane to Use Refactored Functionality (COMPLETED)

1. Locate the main chat pane component in `panes/chat/Chat.tsx` (DONE)
2. Update imports to use the refactored `useChat` hook and any other necessary imports from `chatUtils.ts` (DONE)
3. Ensure all chat functionality is working correctly with the refactored code (DONE)
4. Remove any unused imports or code that's no longer necessary due to the refactor (DONE)

## Step 4: Testing and Verification (IN PROGRESS)

To thoroughly test the refactored chat functionality, please follow these steps:

1. Run the application in a development environment.
2. Test creating a new chat:
   - Click on the "New Chat" button or equivalent UI element.
   - Verify that a new chat thread is created and displayed in the chat list.
3. Test sending messages:
   - Type a message in the input bar and send it.
   - Verify that the message appears in the chat window.
   - Check if the message is correctly associated with the current user.
4. Test receiving messages:
   - If possible, simulate receiving a message from another user or the system.
   - Verify that the received message appears in the chat window.
5. Test chat history:
   - Close the application and reopen it.
   - Verify that previous chat threads and messages are still available.
6. Test chat-specific features:
   - If applicable, test code highlighting by sending a code snippet.
   - Test markdown rendering by sending messages with markdown syntax.
7. Test error handling:
   - Simulate network errors (e.g., disconnect from the internet) and try to send a message.
   - Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.
8. Performance testing:
   - Create a chat with a large number of messages.
   - Scroll through the chat history and verify that the performance is acceptable.
9. Check console for errors:
   - Open the browser's developer tools.
   - Verify that there are no unexpected errors or warnings in the console related to the chat functionality.

Please report any issues or unexpected behavior found during testing.

## Step 5: Code Cleanup and Documentation (TODO)

1. Remove any commented-out code that's no longer needed
2. Update comments and documentation in the refactored files to reflect the new structure
3. Update any project-wide documentation that references the old chat component structure or store/hook usage
