# Pane Refactor Log

This document logs the actions taken to refactor the components in the `components/hud/` directory.

## Files Moved:

1. `components/hud/UserStatus.tsx` -> `panes/user/UserStatus.tsx`
2. `components/hud/balance.tsx` -> `panes/user/Balance.tsx`
3. `components/hud/hud.tsx` -> `panes/Hud.tsx`
4. `components/hud/index.ts` -> `panes/index.ts`
5. `components/hud/pane.tsx` -> `panes/Pane.tsx`

## Actions Taken:

1. Moved `components/hud/UserStatus.tsx` to `panes/user/UserStatus.tsx`
   - Updated import statements:
     - Changed `import { Balance } from '@/components/hud/balance'` to `import { Balance } from '@/panes/user/Balance'`
     - Changed `import { Pane } from '@/components/hud/pane'` to `import { Pane } from '@/panes/Pane'`

2. Moved `components/hud/balance.tsx` to `panes/user/Balance.tsx`
   - No changes to import statements were necessary for this file

3. Moved `components/hud/hud.tsx` to `panes/Hud.tsx`
   - Updated import statements:
     - Changed `import { Pane as PaneComponent } from '@/components/hud/pane'` to `import { Pane as PaneComponent } from '@/panes/Pane'`
     - Changed `import { UserStatus } from './UserStatus'` to `import { UserStatus } from '@/panes/user/UserStatus'`

4. Moved `components/hud/index.ts` to `panes/index.ts`
   - Updated export statements:
     - Changed `export * from './hud'` to `export * from './Hud'`
     - Changed `export * from './pane'` to `export * from './Pane'`
     - Changed `export * from './UserStatus'` to `export * from './user/UserStatus'`

5. Moved `components/hud/pane.tsx` to `panes/Pane.tsx`
   - No changes to import statements were necessary for this file

## Next Steps:

1. Update any remaining import statements in other files that may still be referencing the old `components/hud/` path
2. Remove the now-empty `components/hud/` directory
3. Test the application thoroughly to ensure all functionality related to these components is working as expected
4. Update any documentation or comments that may reference the old file structure
