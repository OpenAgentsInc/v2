# Chat implementation

This document shows the request lifecycle of the chat implementation and key components of the chat functionality.

The openagentsinc/v2 codebase implements this now, with recent updates to the "New Chat" functionality.

Key points:
- The codebase uses Next.js v14 (app router) with React v18, TypeScript, and Vercel Postgres
- All users must be logged in via Clerk
- Database structure is simply `users`, `threads`, and `messages`.
  - See knowledge/database.md for more detail
- A user can have more than one thread open
- The user stays on the home route and the chat is loaded in a HUD-style draggable+resizable modal we call Pane 
  - Panes are managed in store/hud.ts

## Request Lifecycle
1. An authed user visits the home route @ openagents.com
2. The `middleware.ts` file uses the default Clerk middleware so methods like `auth()` and `getCurrentUser()` are available. (Those two methods are server-only)
3. `app/layout.tsx` calls `initDatabase()` to initialize the database connection and ensure seed data is present (temporary / commented out for now)
   - `initDatabase()` in `lib/init-db.ts` ensures the `seed()` function runs only once when the app starts
   - `lib/db/seed.ts` seeds the database with test data
4. The main catchall route `app/[[...rest]]/page.tsx` confirms the user is logged in and shows the `HomeDashboard` component
5. Server component `components/dashboard/HomeDashboard.tsx` renders a pane with the user's chat history and the HUD
6. Client component `components/hud/hud.tsx` renders all chat panes managed by the hud store
   - Panes are defined in `components/hud/pane.tsx` and managed in `store/hud.ts`
7. Each chat pane has a child Chat component defined in `components/chat.tsx` 
   - The Chat component receives the `id` prop, which corresponds to the thread ID

## New Chat Functionality
The "New Chat" button in the sidebar creates a new chat pane with a fresh thread. Here's how it works:

1. The `NewChatButton` component (`components/new-chat-button.tsx`) is rendered in the `ChatHistory` component (`components/chat-history.tsx`).
2. When clicked, the `NewChatButton` uses the `addPane` function from the `useHudStore` (defined in `store/hud.ts`) to create a new chat pane.
3. The `HUD` component (`components/hud/hud.tsx`) renders all chat panes, including the newly created one.
4. Each chat pane renders a `Chat` component with a unique `id` prop, ensuring that each chat has its own thread.

This implementation allows users to create and manage multiple chat threads simultaneously, enhancing the overall user experience and functionality of the application.

## Chat Thread ID Creation and Management

The current implementation of chat thread ID creation and management is facing some issues. Here's an overview of how it should work and the current problems:

1. When a user clicks on a sidebar item or creates a new chat:
   - A Pane component is spawned with a chat ID.
   - This chat ID should be used by the useChat hook to retrieve messages from the correct thread and send messages to it.
   - The ID in the database should be an integer, not a string.

2. Current issue:
   - Temporary string IDs (via nanoid) are being sent to the server on new threads instead of properly created thread IDs from the threads API endpoint.

3. Ideal flow:
   - When a new chat is initiated, a request should be made to the threads API endpoint (app/api/thread/route.ts) to create a new thread.
   - The API should return the newly created thread ID (an integer) from the database.
   - This ID should then be used for all subsequent operations related to that chat thread.

4. Refactoring needed:
   - Remove the use of temporary string IDs generated by nanoid().
   - Ensure that the thread creation process is completed before any messages are sent or retrieved.
   - Update the useChat hook and related components to work with integer IDs instead of string IDs.

5. Components involved:
   - components/new-chat-button.tsx: Should initiate the thread creation process when clicked.
   - components/chat.tsx: Should use the correct integer ID for the thread.
   - hooks/useChat.ts: Should be updated to work with integer IDs and ensure thread creation before any chat operations.
   - hooks/useThreadCreation.ts: May need to be updated or replaced to handle the new thread creation flow.

6. API changes:
   - app/api/thread/route.ts: Ensure this endpoint creates a new thread in the database and returns the integer ID.
   - app/api/chat/route.ts: Update to work with integer thread IDs instead of string IDs.

By addressing these issues and implementing the correct flow for thread ID creation and management, we can resolve the current problems with temporary string IDs and ensure that all chat operations use the correct, database-generated integer IDs for threads.

This implementation will improve the reliability and consistency of the chat system, ensuring that all messages are correctly associated with their respective threads in the database.
