# Chat Refactor Log

## Notes on Refactor

### Step 1: Remove Temporary IDs
- Updated `components/new-chat-button.tsx`:
  - Removed the use of temporary string IDs
  - Implemented an asynchronous function to create a new thread using the API
  - Updated the `addPane` function to use the new thread ID returned from the API
  - Added error handling and loading state

### Step 2: Unify ID Management
- Updated `hooks/useChat.ts`:
  - Changed `currentThreadId` and `threads` in `ChatStore` to use `number` type instead of `string`
  - Updated `UseChatProps` to accept `id` as a `number`
  - Modified `useChat` hook to handle thread creation within the hook itself
  - Removed `useThreadCreation` hook and related logic
  - Updated type annotations throughout the file to use `number` for thread IDs
  - Modified `vercelChatProps` to use `threadId?.toString()` for compatibility

These changes centralize the management of thread IDs and ensure consistency in ID types throughout the chat functionality. The next steps will involve updating other components and API routes to work with the new number-based thread ID system.
