# Chat Refactor Log

## Notes on Refactor

### Step 1: Remove Temporary IDs
- Updated `components/new-chat-button.tsx`:
  - Removed the use of temporary string IDs
  - Implemented an asynchronous function to create a new thread using the API
  - Updated the `addPane` function to use the new thread ID returned from the API
  - Added error handling and loading state

### Step 2: Unify ID Management
- Updated `hooks/useChat.ts`:
  - Changed `currentThreadId` and `threads` in `ChatStore` to use `number` type instead of `string`
  - Updated `UseChatProps` to accept `id` as a `number`
  - Modified `useChat` hook to handle thread creation within the hook itself
  - Removed `useThreadCreation` hook and related logic
  - Updated type annotations throughout the file to use `number` for thread IDs
  - Modified `vercelChatProps` to use `threadId?.toString()` for compatibility

### Additional Changes to Address Type Errors
- Updated `components/chat-panel.tsx`:
  - Modified the `useChat` hook call to parse the `id` prop as a number: `id: id ? parseInt(id, 10) : undefined`

- Updated `components/chat.tsx`:
  - Changed the `useChat` hook call to parse the `propId` as a number: `id: propId ? parseInt(propId, 10) : undefined`

- Updated `components/new-chat-button.tsx`:
  - Modified the `addPane` function call to convert the `threadId` to a string for the `paneProps.id`: `id: threadId.toString()`

These changes ensure type consistency across the application, converting string IDs to numbers where necessary and maintaining compatibility with existing components that expect string IDs. The next steps in the refactor should focus on updating any remaining components or API routes that may still be using string-based IDs, and ensuring that all parts of the application are consistently using number-based thread IDs.
