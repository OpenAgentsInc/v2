# GraphRAG Test Index: User Sign-up Process

## Files
- `auth.ts`
- `convex/auth.config.ts`
- `convex/users.ts`
- `convex/users/createOrGetUser.ts`

## Entities

### Functions
- `createOrGetUser()`
  - Description: Creates a new user in the database or retrieves an existing user
  - File: `convex/users/createOrGetUser.ts`

### Variables
- `getClerkDomain()`
  - Description: Determines the Clerk domain based on the environment
  - File: `convex/auth.config.ts`

## Relationships
- `auth.ts` imports and re-exports `auth` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`
- `convex/users.ts` exports everything from the `convex/users` directory
- `createOrGetUser()` uses Convex's `mutation` and `db` operations

## Communities
1. Authentication
   - Entities: `auth` (from Clerk), `getClerkDomain()`
2. User Management
   - Entities: `createOrGetUser()`

## Process Flow
1. User submits sign-up form (frontend, not shown in the provided files)
2. Clerk handles the initial authentication process
3. `createOrGetUser()` is called with user information from Clerk
4. `createOrGetUser()` checks if the user already exists in the database
5. If the user doesn't exist, a new user record is created in the database
6. If a referrer ID is provided, credits are added to the referrer's account

## Summary
The user sign-up process in OpenAgents utilizes Clerk for authentication and Convex for database operations. The `createOrGetUser()` function plays a central role in creating or retrieving user records in the database. The process also includes a referral system that rewards users who refer new sign-ups with additional credits.

Key components:
1. Clerk: Handles the authentication process
2. Convex: Manages database operations and user data storage
3. `createOrGetUser()`: Creates new user records or retrieves existing ones
4. Referral system: Rewards users for referring new sign-ups

The sign-up process is designed to be efficient, checking for existing users before creating new records, and integrating a referral system to encourage user growth.
