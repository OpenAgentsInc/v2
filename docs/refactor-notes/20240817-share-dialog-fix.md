# Refactor Log: Share Dialog Fix

## Issue
The share dialog in the chat pane was closing automatically after a few seconds, preventing users from interacting with it properly.

## Root Cause
After investigation, it was found that the issue was caused by a combination of factors:
1. An animation effect in the ChatItem component that lasted for 5 seconds.
2. A force update mechanism in the ChatsPane component that was triggering re-renders.
3. Inconsistent handling of the share dialog's open state in the ChatActions component.

## Changes Made

### 1. ChatItem.tsx
- Removed the character-by-character animation of the chat title.
- Simplified the rendering of the chat title to always show the full title without animation.

### 2. ChatsPane.tsx
- Removed the `updatedChatIds` state and related logic.
- Removed the `forceUpdate` state and related logic.
- Removed the useEffect that was clearing `updatedChatIds` after 5 seconds.
- Removed the `handleTitleUpdate` function.
- Updated the `useChat` hook call to remove the `onTitleUpdate` callback.
- Simplified the `ChatItem` key to use only the chat ID.
- Set `isUpdated` prop to `false` for all `ChatItem` components.

### 3. ChatActions.tsx
- Added a `handleCloseShareDialog` function to centralize the logic for closing the share dialog.
- Updated the `AlertDialog` for sharing to use `onOpenChange={handleCloseShareDialog}`.
- Updated the Cancel button in the share dialog to use `onClick={handleCloseShareDialog}`.
- Updated the Share on Twitter action to use `handleCloseShareDialog()` instead of directly setting `setShareDialogOpen(false)`.

## Expected Outcome
These changes should resolve the issue of the share dialog closing automatically after a few seconds. The dialog will now remain open until the user explicitly closes it or performs an action (like sharing on Twitter or copying the link).

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Open a chat in the chat pane.
2. Click the share button to open the share dialog.
3. Confirm that the dialog remains open indefinitely.
4. Test all actions in the share dialog (Cancel, Share on Twitter, Copy Link) to ensure they work as expected.
5. Verify that the chat list doesn't trigger any unexpected re-renders that might affect the share dialog.

## Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback to ensure the issue is fully resolved.
- Consider adding automated tests to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Review other components for similar patterns that might cause unexpected behavior.
