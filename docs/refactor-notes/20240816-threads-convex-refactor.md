# Threads Convex Refactor

Date: 2024-08-16

## Summary of Changes

We have refactored the `convex/threads.ts` file to improve code organization, maintainability, and readability. The main changes include:

1. Created a new directory `convex/threads/` to contain all thread-related functions.
2. Split the original `convex/threads.ts` file into nine new files:
   - `createNewThread.ts`: Contains the `createNewThread` mutation.
   - `createOrGetUser.ts`: Contains the `createOrGetUser` mutation.
   - `deleteThread.ts`: Contains the `deleteThread` mutation.
   - `generateTitle.ts`: Contains the `generateTitle` action.
   - `getLastEmptyThread.ts`: Contains the `getLastEmptyThread` query.
   - `getThreadMessages.ts`: Contains the `getThreadMessages` query.
   - `getUserThreads.ts`: Contains the `getUserThreads` query.
   - `shareThread.ts`: Contains the `shareThread` mutation.
   - `updateThreadData.ts`: Contains the `updateThreadData` mutation.
3. Updated the `convex/threads/index.ts` file to export all the functions from their respective files.
4. Removed the original `convex/threads.ts` file.

## Benefits

This new structure offers several benefits:
- Improved code organization and readability
- Easier maintenance and testing of individual functions
- Better separation of concerns
- Simplified version control for individual functions

## Usage

To use these functions in other parts of the codebase, developers can now import them like this:

```typescript
import { createNewThread, getUserThreads, deleteThread } from '@/convex/threads'
```

This change maintains the existing API while providing a more modular and maintainable structure for the thread-related functions.

## Next Steps

- Update any components or tests that directly import from `convex/threads.ts` to ensure they still work with the new structure.
- Consider adding unit tests for each individual function in the new structure.
- Review and update documentation to reflect the new file structure and import patterns.
- Ensure that all necessary dependencies are correctly imported in each new file.
