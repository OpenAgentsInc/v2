# Chats Pane Default State Update

Date: 2024-08-16

## Summary

The Chats pane was not showing on startup due to it not being included in the default state of the pane store. This issue has been resolved by updating the `store/pane.ts` file to include the Chats pane in the initial state.

## Changes Made

1. Updated `store/pane.ts`:
   - Added a default Chats pane to the initial `panes` array in the `usePaneStore` creation.
   - The default Chats pane has the following properties:
     ```typescript
     {
       id: 'chats',
       type: 'chats',
       title: 'Chats',
       x: 20,
       y: 20,
       width: 300,
       height: 400,
       isOpen: true,
     }
     ```

## Rationale

By including the Chats pane in the default state, we ensure that it is always present when the application starts up, providing a consistent user experience and immediate access to the chat functionality.

## Impact

- Users will now see the Chats pane by default when they first open the application.
- This change improves the discoverability of the chat feature and aligns with the expected behavior of the application.

## Future Considerations

- Monitor user feedback to ensure this default configuration meets user expectations.
- Consider adding more default panes if other core functionalities should be immediately visible to users on startup.
- Evaluate if the default size and position of the Chats pane are optimal for most users' screen sizes and adjust if necessary.

## Related Issues

- Resolves the issue of the missing Chats pane on application startup.

## Testing

- Verify that the Chats pane appears by default when the application is loaded for the first time.
- Test that the pane persists across page reloads and browser restarts.
- Ensure that removing the Chats pane and refreshing the page brings it back to its default state.
