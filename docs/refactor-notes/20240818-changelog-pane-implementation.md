# Changelog Pane Implementation

Date: 2024-08-18

## Overview

This refactor introduces a new 'changelog' pane to the application. The changelog pane is designed to display recent updates and changes to the application, providing users with an easily accessible way to stay informed about new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

## Changes Made

1. Updated `store/pane.ts`:
   - Added a new 'changelog' pane to the initial panes array.
   - The changelog pane is positioned below the Chats pane, with a smaller height and set to be dismissable.

2. Created new files in the `panes/changelog/` directory:
   - `ChangelogPane.tsx`: Implements the basic structure of the changelog pane using Shad UI components.
   - `index.ts`: Exports the ChangelogPane component for easy import.

3. Updated `panes/index.ts`:
   - Added an export for the new changelog pane components.

## Implementation Details

- The changelog pane is initialized with the following properties:
  - id: '1'
  - type: 'changelog'
  - title: 'Changelog'
  - x: 90
  - y: 650 (positioned below the Chats pane)
  - width: 260
  - height: 150 (smaller than the Chats pane)
  - isOpen: true (visible by default)
  - dismissable: true

- The `ChangelogPane` component uses Shad UI's Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle, and ScrollArea components to create a consistent look and feel with the rest of the application.

## Next Steps

To fully implement the changelog feature, the following steps are recommended:

1. Update the `PaneManager` component to render the `ChangelogPane` when the pane type is 'changelog'.
2. Implement the logic to fetch and display actual changelog data in the `ChangelogPane` component.
3. Consider creating a `useChangelogActions.ts` file if any changelog-specific actions are needed.
4. Populate the changelog with real data, possibly fetching it from a backend API or a static file.
5. Implement any necessary styling adjustments to ensure the changelog pane fits well with the existing UI.

## Testing

Thorough testing should be conducted to ensure:
- The changelog pane renders correctly in the HUD.
- The pane can be dismissed and reopened as expected.
- The scrolling functionality works properly for longer changelogs.
- The pane interacts correctly with other existing panes in the application.

## Conclusion

This implementation lays the groundwork for a changelog feature, enhancing user awareness of application updates. Further refinement and integration with actual changelog data will be necessary to complete the feature.
