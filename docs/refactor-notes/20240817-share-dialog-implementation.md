Author: AI Assistant

## Overview
This refactor focused on implementing a new share dialog functionality for chat threads, replacing the previous `isShared` property with a `shareToken` system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created ChatShareDialog Component
- Created a new file: `panes/chats/ChatShareDialog.tsx`
- Implemented a reusable dialog component for sharing chats
- Features include:
  - Displaying chat title and message count
  - Button to generate and copy share link
  - Loading state while sharing

### 2. Updated useChatActions Hook
- Modified: `panes/chats/useChatActions.ts`
- Added `shareChat` mutation using `api.threads.shareThread.shareThread`
- Implemented `isSharing` state to track sharing process
- Updated `handleShare` function to use new `shareChat` mutation
- Modified `getShareUrl`, `handleCopyShareLink`, and `handleShareTwitter` to work with `Chat` objects
- Added error handling and toast notifications

### 3. Updated getSharedThread Query
- Modified: `convex/threads/getSharedThread.ts`
- Replaced `isShared` check with `shareToken` check
- Updated return logic to use `shareToken` instead of `isShared`

### 4. Updated Share Page
- Modified: `app/share/[threadId]/page.tsx`
- Updated to use `shareToken` instead of `isShared`
- Improved error handling for cases where thread is not found or not shared
- Enhanced UI to display thread title and message count

## Expected Outcome
- Users can now share chat threads using a unique `shareToken`
- Improved security and control over shared chats
- Better user experience with a dedicated share dialog
- Consistent error handling and user feedback throughout the sharing process

## Testing
To verify the changes:
1. Open a chat thread
2. Click the share button to open the new share dialog
3. Test generating and copying the share link
4. Verify the shared link works for viewing the chat
5. Check error cases (e.g., trying to share an non-existent thread)

## Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback on the new sharing functionality
- Consider implementing analytics to track usage of shared chats
- Explore additional features for shared chats (e.g., view counts, expiration dates)
