# Users Convex Refactor

Date: 2024-08-18

## Summary of Changes

We have refactored the `convex/users.ts` file to improve code organization, maintainability, and readability. This refactoring follows the same pattern as the recent threads and messages refactors. The main changes include:

1. Created a new directory `convex/users/` to contain all user-related functions.
2. Split the original `convex/users.ts` file into individual files for each function:
   - `createOrGetUser.ts`: Contains the `createOrGetUser` mutation.
   - `getUserData.ts`: Contains the `getUserData` query.
   - `getUserBalance.ts`: Contains the `getUserBalance` query.
   - `updateUserCredits.ts`: Contains the `updateUserCredits` mutation.
   - `updateUserCredits.ts`: Contains the `updateUserCredits` mutation.
   - `saveMessageAndUpdateBalance.ts`: Contains the `saveMessageAndUpdateBalance` mutation.
3. Updated the `convex/users/index.ts` file to export all the functions from their respective files.
4. Updated the main `convex/users.ts` file to act as an index, exporting all functions from the `users` directory.

## Benefits

This new structure offers several benefits:
- Improved code organization and readability
- Easier maintenance and testing of individual functions
- Better separation of concerns
- Simplified version control for individual functions

## Usage

To use these functions in other parts of the codebase, developers can continue to import them as before:

```typescript
import { createOrGetUser, getUserData, updateUserCredits } from '@/convex/users'
```

This change maintains the existing API while providing a more modular and maintainable structure for the user-related functions.

## Next Steps

- Review any components or tests that directly import from `convex/users.ts` to ensure they still work with the new structure.
- Consider adding unit tests for each individual function in the new structure.
- Update any relevant documentation to reflect the new file structure and import patterns.
- Ensure that all necessary dependencies are correctly imported in each new file.

## Relation to Previous Refactors

This refactoring follows the same pattern as the recent threads refactor (2024-08-16) and messages refactor (2024-08-17). It aims to maintain consistency in the codebase structure and improve overall maintainability of the Convex functions.
