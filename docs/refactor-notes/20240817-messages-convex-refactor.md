# Messages Convex Refactor

Date: 2024-08-17

## Summary of Changes

We have refactored the `convex/messages.ts` file to improve code organization, maintainability, and readability. This refactoring follows a similar pattern to the recent threads refactor. The main changes include:

1. Created a new directory `convex/messages/` to contain all message-related functions.
2. Split the original `convex/messages.ts` file into individual files for each function:
   - `saveChatMessage.ts`: Contains the `saveChatMessage` function.
   - `fetchThreadMessages.ts`: Contains the `fetchThreadMessages` function.
   - `getLastMessage.ts`: Contains the `getLastMessage` function.
   - `getChatById.ts`: Contains the `getChatById` function.
3. Updated the `convex/messages.ts` file to act as an index, exporting all the functions from their respective files.
4. Created a `convex/messages/index.ts` file to export all functions from the individual files.

## Benefits

This new structure offers several benefits:
- Improved code organization and readability
- Easier maintenance and testing of individual functions
- Better separation of concerns
- Simplified version control for individual functions

## Usage

To use these functions in other parts of the codebase, developers can now import them like this:

```typescript
import { saveChatMessage, fetchThreadMessages, getLastMessage, getChatById } from '@/convex/messages'
```

This change maintains the existing API while providing a more modular and maintainable structure for the message-related functions.

## Next Steps

- Review any components or tests that directly import from `convex/messages.ts` to ensure they still work with the new structure.
- Consider adding unit tests for each individual function in the new structure.
- Update any relevant documentation to reflect the new file structure and import patterns.
- Ensure that all necessary dependencies are correctly imported in each new file.

## Relation to Threads Refactor

This refactoring follows the same pattern as the recent threads refactor (2024-08-16). It aims to maintain consistency in the codebase structure and improve overall maintainability of the Convex functions.
