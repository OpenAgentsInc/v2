# Pane Refactor Update - 2024-08-16

This document provides an update on the pane refactor that was initiated on 2024-08-15 and outlines the additional work needed to complete the refactoring process.

## Previous Refactor Summary (2024-08-15)

The initial refactor focused on reorganizing the pane-related components and removing the concept of "Hud". Key actions included:

1. Moving and renaming files from `components/hud/` to `panes/`
2. Updating import statements across affected files
3. Renaming the `Hud` component to `PaneManager`
4. Refactoring `HomeAuthed.tsx` to use the new pane structure

## Additional Refactoring (2024-08-16)

The refactoring process has been extended to include the following files:

1. `store/pane.ts`
2. `store/paneUtils.ts`
3. `store/hudActions.ts`

### Objectives

1. Split functions into smaller, more focused units
2. Distribute functionality across multiple files in a new `store/panes/` directory
3. Improve code organization and maintainability

### New File Structure

The refactored code will be organized into the following structure:

```
store/panes/
├── types.ts
├── constants.ts
├── utils/
│   ├── calculatePanePosition.ts
│   ├── adjustPanePosition.ts
│   ├── createNewPaneWithPosition.ts
│   ├── ensureChatsPaneExists.ts
│   └── handleChatPanePosition.ts
├── actions/
│   ├── addPane.ts
│   ├── removePane.ts
│   ├── updatePanePosition.ts
│   ├── updatePaneSize.ts
│   ├── openChatPane.ts
│   ├── bringPaneToFront.ts
│   └── setActivePane.ts
└── index.ts
```

### Key Changes

1. `types.ts`: Contains type definitions for `Pane` and `PaneState`
2. `constants.ts`: Stores constant values used across pane-related functions
3. `utils/`: Contains utility functions for pane calculations and manipulations
4. `actions/`: Houses individual action functions for pane management
5. `index.ts`: Exports all pane-related functions and types for easy import

## Pending Tasks

1. Implement the new file structure in `store/panes/`
2. Refactor existing functions from `store/pane.ts`, `store/paneUtils.ts`, and `store/hudActions.ts` into the new structure
3. Update `store/pane.ts` to use the new modular structure
4. Update import statements in files that use pane-related functions
5. Test thoroughly to ensure all pane functionality works as expected
6. Update documentation to reflect the new structure and any changes in function signatures or usage

## Next Steps

1. Implement the new file structure and refactor the code
2. Update `store/pane.ts` to use the new modular structure
3. Update import statements in affected files
4. Conduct thorough testing of all pane-related functionality
5. Update relevant documentation, including this refactor note, with the final changes and any lessons learned during the process

By completing this refactor, we aim to improve the maintainability and scalability of the pane management system in the application.
