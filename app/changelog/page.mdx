After months of development, Safe migrations can now be activated on development
branches. Activating this feature ensures zero-downtime schema migrations, the
ability to revert schemas, and safeguards against unintended schema
modifications.

<ChangelogEntry version="v3.16.0" date="Apr 10, 2024">
## New Regions and Replicas

Database introduces the capability to set up same-region read replicas. These
replicas are separate, read-only compute units designed to conduct read
operations on the same dataset as their corresponding read-write compute
instances.

<ChangelogImage src="/changelog/v316.webp" />

### Use Regions to advance:

- <Bold>Enhanced Throughput:</Bold> Spread read operations across several
  replicas to improve throughput for all types of workloads, both read-write and
  read-only.
- <Bold>Dedicated Read-only Workloads:</Bold> Assign analytical and reporting
  tasks to a read replica to preserve the performance of your main application
  workload.
- <Bold>Controlled Data Access:</Bold> Grant read-only access to specific
  applications or users who don't require write permissions.
- <Bold>Resource Customization:</Bold> Tailor the CPU and memory resources for
  each read replica according to the specific requirements of different
  applications or users.
- <Bold>Customization Features:</Bold> Instantly create and tailor the resources
  of one or more read replicas for any project branch, adjusting the allocated
  vCPU and memory as needed.

For more information, refer to our docs post on read replicas or the read
replicas section in [the documentation](#).
